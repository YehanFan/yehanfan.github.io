- Conducted user studys to analyze the intricate distribution patterns of gaze points, utilizing gaze data obtained from the Head-Mounted Display's software development kit.
- Proposed a robust and highly precise gaze pointing technique specifically designed for target selection tasks in VR environment, facilitating the accurate prediction of user-intended targets based on Bayes' rule.
- The paper [DEEP: 3D Gaze Pointing in Virtual Reality Leveraging Eyelid Movement](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3526113.3545673) published on UIST '22.

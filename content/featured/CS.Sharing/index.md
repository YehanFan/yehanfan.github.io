Our group aim to build a web app for enhancing information-sharing across the coders. In the end, the goal is to achieve a structured knowledge system that provides a user-friendly interface for users to access and learn computer science knowledge. By implementing a user-driven framework and seeking feedback, the website will be able to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date guidebook of computer science knowledge that is easily accessible to all levels of users.

We build a computer science blog website to facilitate information-sharing among coders that can greatly benefit the developer community. In the end, the goal is to achieve a social media platform for software developers to share their knowledge and experience through posts and discussions. By implementing a user-driven framework and seeking feedback, the website is able to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date guidebook of computer science knowledge that is easily accessible to all levels of users.

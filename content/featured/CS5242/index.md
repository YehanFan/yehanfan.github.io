Inspired by some AI-generated images from sketches, our group realize that sketch images with few lines contain important content. 

In this project, we implemented a sketch-based image search engine that can return 𝑘 real-world fruit images for the user-input sketch. To match real-world images and sketches, we use models to extract image features and compute the similarities among their features. Search Engine would return images with highest similarity.

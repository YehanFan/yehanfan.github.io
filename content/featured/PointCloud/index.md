Semantic segmentation of 3D computer vision is an ongoing research area. In particular, point cloud analysis is one potential solution for this 3D task. Although research has shown great success in semantic segmentation of point cloud scenes, local features learning remains a challenging problem. To address this issue, this project introduces a novel neighboring feature learning model, which construct searching space based on both geometric and non-geometric structures of point cloud. This model is successfully leveraged in any neighbor-searching-based semantic segmentation framework for evaluation and tested on the S3DIS dataset.
